/* Recap

You can create strings with " or '.
.length is a property that gives you the length of a string
.includes(searchString) returns true or false based on whether the searchString was found or not.
.toUpperCase() is a function that converts the string to upper case
.toLowerCase() is a function that converts the string to lower case
parentheses () on functions are required. .length is a property which is already pre-computed thus why it does not need parentheses
console.log(...) is used for debugging and is NOT a replacement for return. */

const text = "Hello World";

text.toUpperCase();

const text = "Code to go has awesome use cases!";

text.includes("Code to go");

const text = "Hello World";

text.toLowerCase();
