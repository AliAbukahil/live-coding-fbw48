No Duplicates!
  A set is a collection of unique items. A set can be formed from an array by removing all duplicate items. Create a program which transforms an array into a set of unique values. See the examples below. Example:
[1, 4, 4, 7, 7, 7] ➞ [1, 4, 7]
[1, 6, 6, 9, 9] ➞ [1, 6, 9]
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] ➞ [2]
[5, 10, 15, 20, 25] ➞ [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

Assignment N5

Dictionary. (take your time on this pls ) also as tip you can use .includes()
 Create a function that takes an initial string and an array of words, and returns a filtered array of the words that start with the same letters as the initial string.
Notes:
If none of the words match, return an empty array.
Keep the filtered array in the same relative order as the original array of words.
Examples:
dictionary(“bu”, [“button”, “breakfast”, “border”]) ➞ [“button”]
dictionary(“tri”, [“triplet”, “tries”, “trip”, “piano”, “tree”]) ➞ [“triplet”, “tries”, trip”]
dictionary(“beau”, [“pastry”, “delicious”, “name”, “boring”]) ➞ []

*/

const dictionary = ("str", [“button”, “breakfast”, “border”]) => {
  let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < str; i++) {
    if ()
  }
};
console.log(dictionary());
